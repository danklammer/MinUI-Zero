# .tmp_update/updater does the actual installation (and later, updating)
#
# ORDER MATTERS AND IT USED TO BE WRONG. This copied the bootstrap, then deleted $MIYOO_PATH — the
# stock-firmware entry point, i.e. the only thing that re-runs this on the next boot — WITHOUT ever
# checking that the copy succeeded. On a full card or an interrupted write that left no bootstrap
# and no way back in.
#
# Now: copy to an INERT staging name, prove the payload actually arrived intact, promote it, and
# only then remove the entry point. If anything failed, leave everything alone and let the stock
# path run again.
#
# Why staging rather than copying straight to .tmp_update: that name is live. A copy interrupted
# part-way used to leave a real, dispatchable .tmp_update/updater sitting there with the rest of the
# payload missing. .tmp_update.new is a name nothing boots from, so a half-written one is inert.
#
# Why more than `-f updater`: the payload is FIVE files and `updater` is one of them. `cp` truncates
# the destination before writing, so a card that fills mid-copy leaves real-but-short files. The
# earlier check passed on a truncated updater, and passed on a complete updater whose companion
# miyoomini.sh — the script `updater` execs — never arrived. Either way the entry point was deleted
# and the device had no way back.
#
# REQUIRED is an explicit list rather than "whatever the source happened to contain": enumerating the
# source cannot detect an incomplete SOURCE. (The build no longer suppresses a failed bootstrap copy
# either, so a short source now fails the build instead of shipping.)
