# MinUI Zero launcher entry point for h700 (Anbernic RG35XX Plus / H).
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. tg5040 and miyoomini have always had a MinUI.pak/launch.sh; h700 did not,
# because our own image starts the launcher by patching muOS's startup.sh instead
# (tools/build-h700-stripped.sh swaps its FRONTEND line for /opt/minui-zero/minui-frontend.sh).
# That works, but it is the only platform where the entry point lives in the OS rather than on the
# card, which (a) breaks the MinUI pak contract every other platform honours and (b) makes the
# frontend un-runnable on any OS layer other than our own muOS strip.
#
# PORTABLE ON PURPOSE. Everything muOS-specific below is guarded by a file test, so this script
# runs unmodified on our own image and on any bare OS layer that merely mounts the card and execs
# this path.
# Things the OS layer owns and this script must NOT duplicate: wifi, ssh, kernel modules, mounts.

# THE LAUNCH LOOP. Ported verbatim from the h700 frontend script rather than from tg5040, because
# the two platforms genuinely differ and the h700 semantics are the audited ones:
#   - tg5040 ends the loop by unlinking /tmp/minui_exec in PLAT_powerOff.
#   - h700 PLAT_powerOff drops /tmp/poweroff instead, so the loop can tell a real power-off request
#     from an ordinary game or menu exit. Without that distinction an in-game power-off looked like
#     a quit and relaunched the same game (audit 2026-08-07).
# A first draft of this file used the tg5040 marker, which would have left the power-off path
# working only by accident and dropped the fail-retry below entirely (caught 2026-08-26).
