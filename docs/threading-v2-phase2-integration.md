# Threading v2 — phase 2 minarch integration map

Wiring plan from `framering.{c,h}` (sanitizer-clean, phase 1) into `minarch.c`, per the
v2.4 contract (`docs/threading-v2-design.md`). This is the call-site map so phase-2 coding
is mechanical. Nothing here changes minarch yet — it's the blueprint.

## Thread split
- **CORE thread** (new): owns the whole libretro session from `dlopen` per F23. Its loop:
  `fr_core_wait_grant` → `core.run()` (one epoch) → CORE-side callbacks call
  `fr_core_emit` → `fr_core_run_done`. Between grants, when parked, it services via
  `fr_core_service_next` / `fr_core_service_emit` / `fr_core_service_ack`.
- **MAIN thread**: the existing run loop becomes the grant/drain driver:
  `fr_grant` on the pacer cadence → `fr_drain` per tick (applies commands, presents frames).

## Callback → framering map (all run ON the CORE thread)
| minarch site | framering call | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `video_refresh_callback` (3245) | `fr_core_emit(KIND_FRAME, persistent?0, slot)` | frame pixels into the granted snapshot slot; NULL data → emit DUP; multiple/none per run handled by RUN_DONE outcome |
| `audio_sample_batch_callback` (3281) | producer side of the audio ring (unchanged SPSC) + config-barrier check | audio ring stays the existing SND SPSC; AV_INFO barrier gates format switch |
| `environment_callback` SET_GEOMETRY | `fr_core_emit(KIND_CMD_GEOMETRY, PERSISTENT)` | persistent = never discarded (F29) |
| `environment_callback` SET_SYSTEM_AV_INFO | `fr_core_emit(KIND_CMD_AVINFO, PERSISTENT)` then `fr_core_barrier_wait` | the barrier: MAIN prefix-drains + applies, wakes CORE (F29) |
| `environment_callback` SET_VARIABLE | `fr_core_emit(KIND_CMD_SETVAR, PERSISTENT)` | core→MAIN option-def change |
| `environment_callback` GET_VARIABLE / input_state | read published snapshot (no emit) | immediate-answer channels: per-epoch snapshot passed via `fr_grant`'s `snapshot[4]` (F20/F30) |

## Bootstrap → service ops (F31 nine-state machine, all on CORE)
Run each as an `fr_service(op)` from MAIN while CORE is QUIESCENT, MAIN draining products:
`CORE_CREATED → get_system_info → set_environment/register → retro_init → content-open →
load_game → get_system_av_info → set_controller → SRAM/RTC size+data+load → arm crash
handler (only here, MEMORY_READY) → audio init → renderer init → auto-resume unserialize →
first fr_grant (RUNNING)`. Per-state failure cleanup = the F31 table (the fake-core oracle).

## Lifecycle → framering map (MAIN)
| minarch event | framering call |
|---|---|
| pacer tick (GFX_sync cadence) | `fr_grant` (if credit) + `fr_drain(APPLY)` |
| menu enter (`Menu_loop` 1906-area) | `fr_park(drain=present-pending)` → menu draws via GFX_flip (unskippable, already so) → on exit `fr_release` |
| `Menu_beforeSleep` (3541) | `fr_park(drain)` then existing SRAM/RTC flush runs as a service op |
| FF toggle | `fr_park(discard)` → `fr_release` (payload discarded, persistent events kept — F29) |
| trial start/stop (#6) | `fr_set_depth(2)` / `fr_set_depth(1)` — the 7-step credit-reclaim gate is inside |
| `State_read`/`State_write`/`Core_reset` (636/681/3416) | `fr_service(SERIALIZE|UNSERIALIZE|RESET)` — executed on CORE per F18 |
| quit (below `finish:`) | `fr_park` → CORE runs unload_game+deinit as service → `fr_stop` → join → dlclose on MAIN |

## Reuses phase-1 correctness (no re-derivation)
- Single mode = `fr_init(depth=1)`; threaded trial = `fr_set_depth(2)`. Same code path.
- Drain indices are NOT contiguous (discard/abort skip indices) — the drain callback must
  not assume gap-free (phase-1 note).
- Lifecycle transitions are lock-serialized inside framering (phase-1 note) — MAIN just
  calls park/release/set_depth; no external locking needed.

## Verification gate before ship (from the v2.4 close + phase-1 report)
1. Adversarial libretro-shaped fake core exercising every F31 bootstrap-failure row.
2. Forbidden-globals audit (`nm`/`objdump`: no cross-thread mutable globals bypass the ring).
3. Release-binary TLS inspection: reject any `__tls_get_addr` on the crash-marker path.
4. On-device gauntlet (the expanded case list) at `-O3 -flto`.
5. Serial-v2 vs v1.3-single energy regression gate; threaded vs serial total-device evidence.

## Sequencing (unchanged)
Task #11's pipeline profile is DONE (floor-control insight); the single-thread baseline that
threading trials measure against will shift again if floor-control ships — recalibrate the
trial threshold after floor-control's ship decision, before threading's final measurements.
Dan's save states (DKC/Yoshi/Mario RPG demanding scenes) remain the measurement arms.

## Phase 2 step 1 - implemented + host-proven (frontend_core engine)

`workspace/all/common/frontend_core.{c,h}` implements the CORE-thread lifecycle
engine over framering, driven by a libretro-shaped vtable: the F31 nine-state
bootstrap machine, the RUNNING epoch loop, the QUIESCENT service loop, and the
per-state **terminal cleanup oracle** (which teardown calls are legal from each
reached state). `frontend_core_test.c` is the adversarial fake core - it fails or
requests-shutdown at every bootstrap stage and emits adversarial runtime patterns -
and asserts the oracle at each stage. Same shipping code, TSan+ASan clean 30s each;
`check-forbidden-globals.sh` confirms neither module holds a mutable file-scope
global (all shared state is ring-owned). This is the integration LOGIC minarch 2b
plugs into (fill the vtable with real libretro calls); the harness tests it, not a
model of it.

## Map-vs-reality findings (phase 2b must honour these - not improvised here)

**F-A. Two bootstrap stages are MAIN-affine, not CORE-affine.** F31 lists audio
init and renderer init as CORE-side service ops, but SDL video/renderer creation is
thread-affine to the thread that owns the window (MAIN), and SDL audio open is
safest on MAIN too. The *libretro* bootstrap stages (get_system_info, init,
load_game, get_av_info, memory setup, resume) are correctly CORE-pinned - those are
the TLS/affinity-critical ones F23 exists for. The fix for 2b: MAIN performs the SDL
audio+renderer init at the **AV_READY boundary** (it has av_info by then), between
the CORE-side AV service-ack and the first grant - i.e. fc_bootstrap splits so the
SDL init happens MAIN-side mid-sequence, rather than as CORE vtable bodies. The
engine already isolates these as the only two vtable hooks that would need to
marshal; treat them as MAIN-side steps in 2b. NON-BLOCKING for the engine.

**F-B. Audio payload is NOT a framering event class (by design).** The audio ring
stays the existing `SND_*` SPSC (producer CORE, consumer SDL callback); framering
carries only video frames, commands (geometry / AV_INFO / SET_VARIABLE), and
lifecycle. The AV_INFO barrier coordinates the audio *config* switch (sample rate) -
the audio *data* rides its own ring. frontend_core models video+command+lifecycle
only; audio integration in 2b is the existing SND ring plus the config-barrier hook.

## Deliberately deferred to step 2 (on-device / toolchain)
The guarded minarch.c wiring is NOT done in step 1: it cannot be host-validated
(needs SDL/libretro/platform + the Docker toolchain), and injecting guard-ON code
that compiles only in the toolchain would be improvising the exact SDL-threading
model F-A flags. Step 2 = fill the vtable in minarch behind ZERO_FRONTEND_THREADING_V2
(default OFF, shipped path byte-identical), apply F-A MAIN-side SDL init split,
compile guard-ON in the toolchain, then the on-device gauntlet + release-binary
__tls_get_addr inspection (needs the aarch64 build - the crash-marker __thread
must resolve to initial-exec, no dynamic TLS resolver).
