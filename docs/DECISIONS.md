# Decisions log — closed-loop thermal governor

Running log of choices made while building the governor autonomously, so the
reasoning survives even when the diff doesn't show it. Newest at the bottom.

## D1 — Module placement: `workspace/all/common/governor.{c,h}`
The governor is shared frontend logic that calls a platform primitive
(`PLAT_setCPUFreq`), exactly like `api.c`. It lives next to `api.c` in
`workspace/all/common/` and is added to `minarch`'s makefile `SOURCE` list. It is
*not* pulled into every platform automatically — only `minarch` compiles it.

## D2 — Split the controller into a pure step + an I/O tick
`docs/thermal-governor-design.md` writes `gov_tick()` with file-static state and an
internal temp read. To make it testable with scripted traces (task 5) and free of
sysfs on non-device builds, the algorithm is factored into:
- `gov_step(GovState*, profile, temp_c, frame_overrun)` — **pure**, no I/O, returns
  next kHz. This is the exact algorithm from the design doc.
- `gov_tick(GovState*, profile, frame_overrun)` — reads temp from the thermal zone,
  calls `gov_step`, writes the result via `PLAT_setCPUFreq`. The device entry point.
- `GovState` struct replaces the design doc's three file-static globals so the
  harness can run many independent controllers and the real path keeps one.
The numbers and branch structure are unchanged from the design doc.

## D3 — Frequency write goes through `PLAT_setCPUFreq(int khz)`
Per the task list. tg5040 writes kHz to `scaling_setspeed` (reusing the existing
`GOVERNOR_PATH`, keeping the `userspace` governor `boot.sh` set). macOS logs instead
of writing. A `FALLBACK_IMPLEMENTATION` (weak) no-op lives in `api.c` so every other
platform (rg35xx, my355, …) still links without change.

## D4 — Temp read stays a direct sysfs read in `governor.c` (graceful -1)
The design doc reads `T_SENSOR` directly. Kept that way (clearly marked ASSUMED).
On any non-device build the path is absent, `fopen` fails, and the reader returns
`-1`, which the controller treats as "temp unknown → don't let temp gate downward
probing." So no extra platform function is needed for temp, and the harness injects
temp directly via `gov_step`.

## D5 — `frame_overrun` reuses minarch's existing frame-budget measurement
`api.c` already computes `SDL_GetTicks() - frame_start` vs `FRAME_BUDGET` (17 ms) to
decide vsync inside `GFX_flip`. We capture that same comparison into a flag exposed
as `GFX_didOverrun()` and feed it to `gov_tick`. No new timing path is introduced.
Caveat: `FRAME_BUDGET` is a fixed 60 Hz budget; for sub-60 Hz cores (PAL, VB, etc.)
a frame that comfortably holds the core's own rate can still read as an "overrun,"
making the governor slightly less eager to downclock those cores. This is
conservative (never unsafe) and is flagged as an on-device tuning item.

## D6 — Governor is authoritative during gameplay; the static CPU menu stays
The existing in-game `minarch_cpu_speed` menu (`setOverclock`) is left in place to
keep scope tight (the task says replace the *pick*, not remove the menu). Because
`gov_tick` rewrites `scaling_setspeed` every tick (~0.5 s), it re-asserts its clock
over whatever the static menu last set, so the governor wins during gameplay without
ripping out UI. Menu/sleep clocks (`CPU_SPEED_MENU`) are untouched.

## D7 — Per-pak `launch.sh` exports `MINARCH_FMIN` / `MINARCH_FMAX` (kHz)
Most flexible wiring for "per-system f_min/f_max": each emu pak exports its two clock
bounds as env vars; minarch reads them on game load and builds the profile. If the
vars are absent (un-updated pak / other platform), minarch falls back to a safe
default profile (`600000`/`2000000` kHz) — guaranteed to hold frame rate, governor
sinks from there. Profile numbers come from the design doc's P_8BIT / P_16BIT / P_PS1
brackets, mapped per system.

## D8 — Local build flag `-U__ARM_ARCH` for macOS verification only
`api.c` selects 32-bit ARM inline-asm blend helpers under `#if __ARM_ARCH >= 5`,
which clang cannot assemble on arm64 Apple Silicon (`__ARM_ARCH==8`). The documented
build command predates Apple Silicon. `-U__ARM_ARCH` forces the identical C-fallback
blend locally. This is a **local verification flag only** (in `.notes/verify.sh`); no
committed source changes, and it does not touch the render path. On the real Linux
cross-toolchain (`make tg5040`) and Intel Macs the stock command is unaffected.

## D9 — Governor safety hatch: `GOV_DISABLE` env
Setting `GOV_DISABLE=1` makes `gov_tick` a no-op (governor off, static menu clock
stands). Default is on. Cheap, reversible escape hatch for on-device bring-up.
