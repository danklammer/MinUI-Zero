// Audio ring occupancy servo: the pure control law, unit-tested in audioservo_test.c
// (make test-audioservo). The loop wiring (eligibility, block detector, hand-back) lives in
// minarch.c; nothing here touches the resampler or knows about threads.
//
// Cubic on occupancy error: nearly silent within a few points of the setpoint (5 points off is
// 160ppm), the full rail at the band edges (50% and 100%). Borrowed in shape from NextUI's
// buffer-fill term (their rail is ~4.3%; RetroArch caps timing skew at 5%); ours stops at 2%,
// ~35 cents of pitch for a second or two after a drain, because Zero's answer to a sustained
// slowdown is the clock or the stall, never detuned music. The applied trim is smoothed with a
// first-order filter so the resampler never sees a step (NextUI averages ~120 batches, ~2s).
//
// SIGN (the thing to get right): sample_rate_in_adj = in * (1e6 + ppm) / 1e6, so a HIGHER ppm
// treats the input as faster = fewer output frames per input frame = the ring DRAINS. Low
// occupancy therefore needs a NEGATIVE trim.
