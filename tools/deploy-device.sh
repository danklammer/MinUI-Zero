# WHY THIS SYNCS THE WHOLE TREE, not a hand-picked file list.
# An earlier version copied four files (minarch.elf, minui.elf, MinUI.pak/launch.sh, one core).
# That is unsound whenever a change spans files, and it bit immediately: MinUI.pak/launch.sh was
# updated to hand the audio shim to minarch via MINARCH_PRELOAD instead of exporting LD_PRELOAD,
# but the eight Emus/*/launch.sh that CONSUME MINARCH_PRELOAD were not in the list. The device ran
# a new MinUI.pak against stale emu paks, so the shim never reached minarch, SDL picked the `dsp`
# driver, /dev/dsp could not be opened without libpadsp, and every game lost audio. The repo was
# correct the whole time; only the deploy was partial.
#
# So: compare md5 of every file and send whatever differs. First run is slow (~48MB), later runs
# send only what changed.
#
# NOT scp. The MMP firmware ships neither /usr/libexec/sftp-server (so modern scp, which speaks
# SFTP by default, dies "Connection closed") nor an scp binary (so `scp -O`, the legacy-protocol
# fallback, dies "scp: not found"). Piping through the shell needs only cat, which busybox has.

# TWO PAYLOAD ROOTS, not one. `make <platform>` stages BOTH build/PAYLOAD/.system/<platform> and
# build/PAYLOAD/Tools/<platform>, which land on the card at /mnt/SDCARD/.system/<platform> and
# /mnt/SDCARD/Tools/<platform>. Syncing only the first is the same partial-deploy bug this script
# was written to prevent, and it bit exactly that way on 2026-08-30: the Tools paks draw their UI
# with their OWN binaries (Clock.pak/clock.elf, Input.pak/minput.elf, plus the confirm.elf and
# say.elf the others call), all of which compute geometry from platform.h. A Brick Pro therefore
# kept rendering Tools at Smart Pro size after a "successful" deploy that reported a full match,
# because the entire Tools half of the payload was never examined. Worse, MinUI.pak/launch.sh
# re-arms the undervolt harness from Tools/ at every boot, so the consumer updated while the
# producer did not. Sync every root or the "whole-tree" guarantee in the header above is a lie.

# .tmp_update is the BOOT DISPATCH (tg5040.sh, updater, the boot artwork). It is not per-platform:
# the staged directory is shared, and it is what runs before the launcher on every boot. Omitting

# That was invisible while the sheets never changed; the Brick Pro's assets@2.5x.png broke the
# assumption, and a binary that selects a sheet its card does not carry does not degrade, it
# segfaults (api.c calls IMG_Load then hands the result to SDLX_SetAlpha). Fourth root.

TWO DIFFERENT RESTARTS — they do not pick up the same things.

  $SSH $TARGET 'kill -9 \$(pidof minui.elf)'
      Picks up minui.elf, minarch.elf, the cores, and every Emus/*/launch.sh (those are read
      fresh on each game launch). This only makes MinUI.pak/launch.sh ITERATE its menu loop;
      everything above the loop, including audio_daemon_start and the boot-path daemon release,
      does NOT re-run. The running shell also still holds the OLD MinUI.pak/launch.sh inode,
      because this script installs via mv.
      MUST be SIGKILL by pid: 'killall minui.elf' and plain TERM are PROVEN no-ops on this
      firmware (the vendor SDL2 catches SIGTERM and posts SDL_QUIT, which minui ignores).

  full power cycle
      The ONLY way to exercise a MinUI.pak/launch.sh change or anything about daemon startup
      ordering. The daemon can only win MI_AO at boot, before the menu opens the codec, so daemon
      behaviour is simply not testable without one.
