# NOTE: an "efficiency" kill of muOS idle daemons (lowpower/keepalive/muhotkey/activity) lived here
# but was removed (2026-08-06). It was an UNMEASURED optimization — the thesis is "earn it by
# measurement," and this was vibes ("loops burn wakeups") without a wakeup receipt or a per-service
# safety check. keepalive.sh in particular is a plausible network keepalive, and a device that boots
# then drops wifi (seen live) is a far worse outcome than a few shell-loop wakeups. Revisit only with
# a measured per-service wakeup cost + a proven-safe-to-kill check, one service at a time.

# CODEC INIT (audio): restore the mixer state (unmute + digital volume 24) SYNCHRONOUSLY before
# minui starts. startup.sh's line-63 `pipewire.sh start &` also does this, but BACKGROUNDED, so it
# races minui's InitSettings (which reads the codec volume ONCE at launch). Losing that race left
# digital volume at the power-on 0 = dead silent (found live 2026-08-06). Doing it here, blocking,
# guarantees the codec is unmuted and at its 24 baseline before minui ever reads it.

# WiFi + SSH bring-up. Credentials are USER-SUPPLIED (never baked into the image): the MinUI
# convention is a wifi.txt at the SD-card root, "SSID:password" per line, '#' comments. We use the

# stays quiet, so the efficient default is untouched.
#
# WiFi is delegated ENTIRELY to muOS's own net.sh connect — the exact flow that already connects
# reliably on this chip. Hand-rolling it (our own wpa/dhcp/keepalive) is what broke it repeatedly, so
# we stop and reference the fork: repopulate muOS's config from the user's wifi.txt and call
# `network.sh connect`, which runs the whole proven bring-up — loads 8821cs off the SDIO controller
# (device network.sh LOAD_NETWORK; a boot never loads it on its own), scans, builds the wpa config with
# wpa_passphrase (password.sh), DHCPs, validates, then starts keepalive.sh: muOS's own rtw_power_mgnt=0
# idle-drop fix (credit johnnyonflame) plus a reconnect monitor. Verified the image's device config has
# what the flow reads: board/name=rg35xx-plus (driver-load path), network/type=nl80211 (wpa starts),
# network/iface=wlan0. Ref: net.sh / password.sh / keepalive.sh under /opt/muos/script.
