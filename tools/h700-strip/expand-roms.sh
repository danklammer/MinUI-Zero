# One-shot ROMS expansion for the MinUI Zero h700 image. Runs from startup.sh BEFORE muOS mounts
# the card, because parted refuses to resize a partition that is in use.
#
# The flashed image is ~1.4GB, so on a bigger card everything past the ROMS partition is
# unreachable. Measured on-device 2026-08-10 (sysfs, 32GB card): disk 61071360 sectors, ROMS starts
# at 2416640 and is 524288 long, leaving 58130432 sectors (27.7GiB) stranded.
#
# There is no in-place FAT32 grow here (parted, sfdisk, mkfs.vfat, partx are present; fatresize and
# resize2fs are not), so this does what muOS's own factory reset does: resize the partition,
# reformat, restore. It restores OUR payload from a verified copy instead of an archive.
#
# HISTORY, so the traps stay fixed (2026-08-10):
#   1. v1 ran after the card was mounted and used `umount -l`. /proc/mounts looked clean while the
#      filesystem was still busy, so parted only printed "Partition is being used ... Yes/No?" and
#      did nothing. mkfs then reformatted at the OLD size and the script reported success because it
#      never measured the result. No data was lost, but nothing was gained either.
#   2. v2 fixed the timing but split the work across a forced reboot, which introduced worse
#      failures: an interrupted second phase would overwrite the good backup with a half-restored
#      card, and a power cut in one specific window disabled expansion permanently.
# So: one uninterrupted pass, `partx -u` to refresh the kernel view instead of rebooting, an ATTEMPT
# marker that is never retried automatically, and success only when the result is measured.
